## Project Overview-
This project evaluates the effectiveness of a new ad campaign (treatment) compared to a public service announcement (control) using A/B Testing .The analysis provides insights into conversion behavior, revenue impact, and engagement patterns to guide data-driven marketing decisions.
## Business Questions Answered
- Which campaign drove higher conversion rates?
- Is the difference in performance statistically significant?
- What is the revenue impact of running ads vs. PSA?
- How does ad frequency influence conversions?
- Which day of the week and time of day yield the best conversions?
## Key Insights
- Ads outperformed PSAs with a statistically significant lift in conversions.
- The Z-test confirmed the difference in conversion rates was meaningful (p < 0.05).
- Estimated revenue from ads was higher, proving direct business impact.
- Ad frequency analysis revealed optimal exposure ranges to avoid ad fatigue.
- Evening time slots had the strongest conversions compared to other times.
